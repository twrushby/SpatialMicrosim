# About

This document was created to record the code and output of the example spatial microsimulation in Robin Lovelace's book Spatial microsimulation with R <http://robinlovelace.net/spatial-microsim-book/>.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Introduction

##Â Why use spatial microsim?

"Spatial Microsimulation is useful when you have an intermediary amount of data available: geographically aggregated count and a non-spatial survey." Lovelace - Spatial microsimulaton with R

# Microsim example

## Load data

```{r load_ind_data}
ind <- read.csv()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
